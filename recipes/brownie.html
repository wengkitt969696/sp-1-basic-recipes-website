      <p>
        This brookie recipe was inspired by a co-worker who couldn't decide if
        she wanted brownies or chocolate chip cookies for her birthday treat.
        Since she said I should just pick one, I thought this up on the way
        home. I couldn't find a recipe like it on Allrecipes, so I created it.
        These brookies go quickly; I usually make a double batch in a jelly roll
        pan.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
              9x13-inch baking dish.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prepare cookie layer: Beat butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and
              vanilla in a large bowl until creamy. Add egg; beat until light
              and creamy, about 2 minutes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Whisk together flour, salt, and baking soda in a bowl. Gradually
              stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is combined.
              Stir chocolate chips into dough. Spread dough evenly into the
              prepared baking dish; set aside.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prepare brownie layer: Stir together sugar, melted butter, and
              vanilla in a bowl; add eggs and beat well. Mix in cocoa powder
              until well-combined. Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt until
              batter is combined. Pour over cookie layer and spread to cover
              completely.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the
              center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely before
              cutting into 20 bars.
